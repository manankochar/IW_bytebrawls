    <h1>Step 1: Mixing the Dough</h1>
    <h5>1.In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        2.In a larger mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.
       3.Pour the yeast mixture into the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.
       4.Knead the dough lightly for a few minutes until it's smooth. Shape it into a rectangle, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</h5>

    <h1>Step 2: Preparing the Butter Block</h1>
    <h5>1.While the dough is chilling, it's time to create the butter block. Place the cold butter between two sheets of parchment paper.
        2.Pound the butter with a rolling pin to flatten and shape it into a rectangle, roughly the same size as your dough.
        3.Refrigerate the butter block until it's firm but still pliable</h5>

    <h1>Step 3: The First Fold</h1>
    <h5>1.Roll out the chilled dough into a larger rectangle on a floured surface.
        2.Place the butter block on one half of the dough and fold the other half over it.
        3.Seal the edges by pressing them together gently.
        4.Rotate the dough 90 degrees and roll it out again into a rectangle.
        5.Fold the dough into thirds, like you're folding a letter.</h5>

   <div>
    <h1>Step 4: The Second Fold</h1>
    <h5>1. Refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes.
        2. Repeat the rolling and folding process as in Step 3.
        3. Refrigerate for another 30 minutes.</h5>
   </div>
   <div>
     <h1>Step 5: The Final Fold</h1>
     <h5>1. Repeat the rolling and folding process once more.
        2. Chill the dough for at least 1 hour or overnight.</h5>
        <div>
            <h1>Step 6: Shaping the Croissants</h1>
            <h5>1.Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.
                2.Cut the dough into triangles, with the base of each triangle being about 4 inches wide.
                3.Make a small slit at the base of each triangle and gently roll it up towards the tip, creating the classic croissant shape.</h5>
